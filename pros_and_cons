this file lists +pros and -cons for the translucency linux kernel module

+works for recent linux kernel v2.4 (2.4.3-2.4.18 tested)
-compatibility for v2.2 has been lost (see old/transhack4.c for thus)

+transparent to user-space-processes
+no recompiling of statically linked binaries etc
+transparent to the kernel - thus all fs and medii should work
-has to be recompiled for every kernel and for every update
-only for i386 yet
-harder to debug
-can crash the machine
-can only be loaded once, only overlay two directories (could be extended)
-needs more security-checks

+management and info per /proc/sys/translucency/*
+creates dirs when needed
+copies files on the fly
-sometimes too many ("touch file" must copy it)
-wastes space since it is no versioning system
+does not try to copy devices/fifos/sockets or /proc/something
-symlinks are followed, but not redirected properly
+avoids directory loops

+merges directory listings
+does not need special index or container files
+thus fast
+can virtually delete files in from=dir (using whiteout entries)
-can sometimes put files in wrong dir when to= is_subdir of from= or other way round (bug)
